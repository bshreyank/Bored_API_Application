Concurrency in Dart refers to the ability of the Dart programming language to execute multiple tasks or computations at the same time. Dart provides several mechanisms for handling concurrency, allowing developers to write programs that can efficiently perform multiple operations concurrently, whether it's running tasks in parallel or handling asynchronous operations.

Here are key concepts related to concurrency in Dart:

1. **Isolates:**
   - Dart uses a concept called isolates for concurrent programming. An isolate is a separate memory heap and runs independently of other isolates, enabling true parallelism.
   - Each isolate has its own event loop and does not share memory with other isolates. Communication between isolates is achieved through message passing.

2. **Async/Await:**
   - Dart supports asynchronous programming using the `async` and `await` keywords. This allows developers to write code that doesn't block the execution of the program while waiting for tasks like I/O operations, network requests, or timers.

   ```dart
   Future<void> fetchData() async {
     print('Fetching data...');
     // Simulate a delay
     await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
     print('Data fetched!');
   }

   void main() {
     print('Start of the program');
     fetchData();
     print('End of the program');
   }
   ```

   In this example, `fetchData` is an asynchronous function, and `await` is used to wait for the asynchronous operation to complete without blocking the entire program.

3. **Futures:**
   - Dart uses `Future` objects to represent values or errors that might be available in the future. A `Future` is a placeholder for a value that hasn't been computed yet.

   ```dart
   Future<String> fetchData() {
     return Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () => 'Data fetched!');
   }

   void main() {
     print('Start of the program');
     fetchData().then((result) {
       print(result);
     });
     print('End of the program');
   }
   ```

   In this example, `fetchData` returns a `Future<String>`, and the result is processed using the `then` method when the future completes.

4. **Streams:**
   - Dart provides the `Stream` class to work with sequences of asynchronous events. Streams allow developers to handle data as it becomes available over time.

   ```dart
   Stream<int> countStream() async* {
     for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
       await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
       yield i;
     }
   }

   void main() async {
     await for (int count in countStream()) {
       print('Count: $count');
     }
   }
   ```

   In this example, `countStream` is a stream generator that yields numbers from 1 to 5 with a delay. The `await for` loop is used to iterate over the stream and print each count.

Concurrency in Dart enables developers to write responsive and efficient programs by handling multiple tasks simultaneously. It provides tools for working with asynchronous operations, isolates for parallelism, and constructs like Futures and Streams for managing asynchronous data flow.
